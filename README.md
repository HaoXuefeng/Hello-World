# Hello-World
Just a beginning of me
Hi humans!
It's the very first day of my GitHub and I imagine it will be one of the remarkble day of my life.
Of course, I thghout I can do something more, something big and good for humanbeing.
By the way, I'm CHINESE, it's important.
I don't know what to write down but... it's told me just write something, anything.So I think I have finished my job.
